Her aim with this project is also to propose an eco-friendly way of creating art by reusing household waste as a surface to draw or paint on. These drawings have been selected for exhibitions like Derwent Art Prize and Wales Contemporary in 2020.</p><p class="statementtext">In her paintings, she seeks to share her experience of calm and beauty in the places she visits with an emphasis on landscapes, flora and architecture.</p></div>
